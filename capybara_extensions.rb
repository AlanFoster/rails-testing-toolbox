  # Provide a select() method that will close the select dropdown
  # after selection automatically. This avoids the sporadic test
  # failures that sometimes occur when a feature spec performs
  # these steps:
  #
  # 1. Spec selects option from dropdown
  # 2. Dropdown does not close fast enough after selection and obstructs button
  # 3. Spec tries to click obstructed button
  # 4. Button click fails silently due to the dropdown obstruction
  # 5. Spec fails
  #
  # The above steps aren't reliably reproducible as the dropdown does
  # often close fast enough after selection. It appears to be easier
  # to reproduce on slower environments (e.g. CI env).
  #
  # This fix works by introducing a custom select method to prevent
  # Capybara automatically forwarding select() calls to page.select().
  #
  # Allows us to customize behaviour whilst also calling
  # page.current_scope.select (defined in Capybara::Node::Actions#select)
  # which is responsible for doing the actual selection work.
